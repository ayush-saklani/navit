## Reporting a Vulnerability

Create an [issue](https://github.com/zrwusa/data-structure-typed/issues/new/choose)
and add the label "security" to report a vulnerability. Since this is right now maintained in free time,
it might take a while. Providing a detailed description or a pull request with the fix are
the best ways to support and speed up the process.
