# Generated code, do not modify manually.

-   All files in this directory are minified from source code in the project hosted at [src](../src).
-   Generated files should be supported in all major browsers.

## [deprecation notice]
Its not recommended to use the minified script from this directory directly. These contain the script based on top of the tree and may not have been tested for production.

### Recommended ways to use
#### Using directly in browser without any loader
If you are not using any loader, you can get the latest UMD javascript code in production from [https://unpkg.com/html5-qrcode](https://unpkg.com/html5-qrcode).

```js
<script src="https://unpkg.com/html5-qrcode" type="text/javascript">
```

> In case you installed the plugin using npm but still use javascript without any module loader, you can get the minified script in node_modules/html5-qrcode/html5-qrcode.min.js

#### Using with module loaders
Include the script with
```js
// To use Html5QrcodeScanner
import {Html5QrcodeScanner} from "html5-qrcode"

// To use Html5Qrcode
import {Html5Qrcode} from "html5-qrcode"
```

**./minified/ scripts will be deprecated by 01/01/2022**
