we can do one thing 
we can make a array of floors for show the polylines floor wise
7 floors so the length of array will be 7
and each will contain that array containing the coordinates of that floor and we will make 
the polyline according to the floor 






this is done but floor plan is a bit changed 0 means basement floor 1 means ground floor 
g.node(0).label='30.2731289,77.9997726';  this is the coordiante detail good for one floor 
g.node(0).label='30.2731289,77.9997726, 1 '; this will be new type by this we will push the first two 
values into array and third into the floor array
