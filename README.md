# ‚≠ê Current Ideas and Features for Development

## Version 1.0  ‚úÖ
- [x] Started with a problem in mind and the problem unveiled and changes the significant app fundamental approaches to solve the problem and new approaches were used. 
- [x] Route Management - Add routes using GeoJSON and calculate the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm and appropriate data structures.
- [x] Dynamic Floor Polylines - Create an array of floors to show the polylines floor-wise. Each array element will contain coordinates for that specific floor to create the polyline accordingly.                
___~~(Floor numbering: 0 for ground floor, 1 for first floor and 6 for underground).~~___
- [x] Implement basic functionality for routing.
- [x] Data Structure design and Implementation
- [x] Complete UI Design and improvements.
- [x] Complete Map were Designed in GeoJSON and later improvements were made.
- [x] Complete Routes were Designed in GeoJSON and later improvements were made.
- [x] Utilize the Leaflet library to draw routes on the map with polylines, dynamically using coordinates as an array of strings input.
## Version 1.1 ‚úÖ
- [x] Fetch Requests - Move all fetch requests to `server.js` for privacy and security.
- [x] Basic API Design and Implementation.
- [x] Automate direction finding and identify idle classrooms and labs by storing timetables in the database _**(Possible API integration with class-sync)**_.
- [x] ___Floor numbering changed for ease: 0 for underground floor, 1 for ground floor and so on.___ üü¢
- [x] Dynamic Centering - setting dynamic center by using cookies to add coordinates to center. Use the last coordinate to determine the center.
- [x] Database Integration - Introduce a database to store custom maps and routes.
- [ ] _~~Possibly restrict mapping functionalities to within the campus IP or network for safety concerns~~_ **_(cancelled or postponed indefinitely)_**
## Version 2.0 ‚úÖ
- [x] *Code Migration* - Migration of code into ReactJS completely 
- [x] **Class-sync** - Integration of Class-sync APIs with Navit.
## Version 2.1 ‚åõ *( Currently Under Development )*
- [x] __Authentication and Security__ - Implement SigIn/SignUp authentication for students to verify users. _(temporary guest mode is also for project showcase)_
- [x] __QR code support__ - Now QR codes can be set in the campus which can be used in the app. This can also be utilized by the clubs and department for event advertisement.
- [ ] __React Native__ - Analyze the benefits and scope of code Migration in React Native.
